Creating a new project:

1. Create a custom makefile C project in the directory DataNetwork 
2. Put evetything cnet related into the folder DataNetwork/cnet-3.2.3

Project specific:

1. Coding style and indentation: GNU
2. Documentation tool: doxygen
3. No need to build, so in Project settings under C/C++ build:

 under Builder settings tab:

 	uncheck "Use default build command"
 	remove the "Build command"
 	uncheck "Generate Makefiles automatically"
 under Behavior tab:
	uncheck everything

Running the project:

1. Under Run > Run configurations

Under main tab:
  Project: DataNetwork 
  C/C++ Application: cnet-3.2.3/cnet

Under arguments tab:
  programming-lab/saarnet-1.txt

Then simply use the run button to test the code
